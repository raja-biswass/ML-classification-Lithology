# ML-classification-Lithology
Codes for applying 14 different ML classification 
This reposir=try contains codes for applying 14 different machine learning algorithm to classify different lithology units. Codes are available for classify lithology using the raster values obtained fro different datasets such as Seninel-2A PCA (Classifi_S2PC_data.ipynb), Sentinel-1A backscatters (Classifi_backsc_data.ipynb), S
