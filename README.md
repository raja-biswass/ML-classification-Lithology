# ML-classification-Lithology
Codes for applying 14 different ML classification 
This repository contains codes for applying 14 different machine learning algorithms to classify different lithology units. Codes are available for classifying lithology using the raster values obtained from different datasets such as Seninel-2A PCA (Classifi_S2PC_data.ipynb), Sentinel-1A backscatters (Classifi_backsc_data.ipynb), Scattering paremeters (Classifi_decom_data.ipynb), and GLCM (Classifi_glcm_data.ipynb). Also, codes for calcualting feature importance are availble as FI_XGB_classifier.ipynb, FI_RandomForestRegressor.ipynb, FI_DecisionTreeRegressor.ipynb.

In addition, codes are available to classify lithology using rasters values obtained from the bands befor and after feature selection (Classifi_all_data_beforeFI.ipynb, and Classifi_afterFI3.ipynb)

Also, codes to apply Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Lightgbm) classifier on composite satellite images are also available as Classifi_compo_Fi.ipynb.
